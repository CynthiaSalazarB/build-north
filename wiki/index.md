# Build North project wiki

Shared notes for Lumente: context, research and analysis that don't belong in the code.
Decisions go in [`DECISIONS.md`](../DECISIONS.md) and nowhere else. Longer reasoning behind one goes
in the entry itself, or in a `context/` page the entry links to. Connection details and secrets never
go here: the repo is public.

To add a page, put it in `context/` or `synthesis/` with this frontmatter, then add a row below and a
line in [`log.md`](log.md):

```yaml
---
title: "Page title"
type: context | synthesis
related: []
created: YYYY-MM-DD
updated: YYYY-MM-DD
---
```

Source documents (PDFs, saved articles) stay out of the repo, since it's public. Link to them from the
page under a Sources heading, the way the SurrealDB prize page does.

## Context

| [Submission checklist](context/submission-checklist.md) | What Devpost and each prize ask for, read from the source pages: the dates, who can enter, what the page must include, each prize's evidence, the criteria, with an owner and a date per line | 2026-10-22 |
